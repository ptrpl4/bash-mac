## Syntax

### comments '# '
```bash
# one line

git status # inline

: '
long
comment
'

# comment with shell output
echo 'my words'
# stdout > my words
```

### quotes ' ' " "

```bash
# ''
echo 'inside $SINGLE \\quotes\\ everything will be a `string`'

# "" will suppress both word splitting and globbing
# will process special characters like `$`, `\`, and `` ` ``
echo "$HOME"
# /Users/admin
```

### parentheses

#### single ( )

will run the commands inside in a subshell

```bash
# (its like subshell, all changes left inside)
MYVAR='mytext'
(MYVAR=new-text-inside-parentheses; echo $MYVAR)
# new-text-inside-parentheses
echo $MYVAR
# mytext
```

#### dollar single $( )

This is for interpolating a subshell command output into a string

```bash
intro="My name is $( whoami )"
echo $intro
# => My name is ryan

# And just to prove that it's a subshell...
a=5
b=$( a=1000; echo $a )
echo $b
# => 1000
echo $a
# => 5
```
#### double (( ))

```bash
i=4
((i += 6))"; echo $i
# 10

((1+1)) # result = 2 = exit code 0 (success)
echo $?  # Check the exit code of the last command
# 0

MYVAR=$((10/2)); echo $MYVAR
# 5

# You can't use it in an expression
a=(( 4 + 1 ))
# => bash: syntax error near unexpected token '('
```

#### dollar double $(( ))

Double Parentheses + Arithmetic Interpolation

```bash
a=$(( 16 + 2 ))
message="I don't want to brag, but I have like $(( a / 2 )) friends."
echo $message
# => I don't want to brag, but I have like 9 friends."

b=$(( a *= 2 )) # You can even do assignments.  The last value calculated will be the output.
echo $b
# => 36
echo $a
# => 36

echo $(( 9 / 2 ))  # You might expect 4.5
# => 4

echo $(( 9 / 2.5 ))
# => bash: 9 / 2.5 : syntax error: invalid arithmetic operator (error token is ".5 ")
```

### curly braces { }

Single curly braces are used for expansion.

```bash
echo h{a,e,i,o,u}p
# => hap hep hip hop hup
echo "I am "{cool,great,awesome}
# => I am cool I am great I am awesome

echo {01..10}
# => 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10
echo {01..10..3}
# => 01 04 07 10
```

### dollar braces ${ }

```bash
# I want to say 'bananaification'
fruit=banana
echo $fruitification
# => "" No output, because $fruitification is not a variable.
echo ${fruit}ification
# => bananaification
```

### square brackets
#### single \[ ]

alternative to the built-in `test` command

```bash
VAR1=2
VAR2=3

if [ $VAR1 -lt $VAR2 ]
then
    echo "$VAR2 is greater than $VAR1"
else
    echo "$VAR1 is greater than $VAR2"
fi
```

#### double \[\[ ]]

```bash
name="Alice"

[[ $name = *c* ]] && echo "Name includes c"

echo $?

# Since string Alice contains the letter â€” c, the output will be 0
```

### man

**parameter** - argument or data that is passed to a command
**options** - command line options or flags, that modify the operation. short `-o` (dash-o), long `--option` (dash-dash-option)

syntax:
- `<param>` - `< >` required param
- `[param]` - `[ ]`optional param, only one
- `[params...]` - `[...]` optional param, can be more than one `...`

examples:
- `fetch formula|cask [...]` fetch command optionally can take more than one params of formula or cask
- `[-f file | string]` -f can take one of two parameters file or string
- `[--user username]` `[-i interval]` optional options with params
- `[-h]` option without param

```bash
# man examples
say
[-v voice] 
[-r rate] 
[-o outfile [audio format options] | -n name:port | -a device] 
[-f file | string ...]

# one more
command [params...] [-options...] | command_two <param> [-options...]

# another example
cmd [param 1|param 2] 
```

### variables

[how-to-read-and-set-vars](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-linux)

persistent environment variables:
- `PATH` â€” A list of directories separated by colons
- `TEMP` â€” The location where processes can store temporary files
- `HOME` â€” The path to where the home directory is located
- `USER` â€” The currently logged-in user
- `EDITOR` â€” The default text editor
- `SHELL` â€” The path of the current userâ€™s shell, such as bash or zsh
- `LANG` â€” The current locales settings.

system files:
- `/etc/environment` is a system-wide configuration file used to store path and locale settings in the form of name-value pairs.
- `/etc/profile` is a startup script file. Commands in this file are executed after user login.
- `~/.bashrc` is a user-specific startup script file that contains configurations specific to the terminal. Commands in this file are executed when you run a new bash terminal.

```bash
# set shell var
MY_TASK="project-1955"
TOKEN="bblablatoken64"

# check value
echo $TASK

# usage
open https://main-url-$MY_TASK.nl-k8s-stage.srv.local\?token=$TOKEN

# unset
unset MY_TASK

# check shell vars
set | less

# convert existing shell var to env var
export TASK

# create env var
export NEWVAR="wow i am"

# check env vars
printenv | less
```

### Glob patterns (Globbing)

Typically globbing is about file names.

- `*` - Any character (except `/`) in any number, or no characters at all
- `?` -  Any one character
- `[]` or `{}` - A group of characters {file1, file3, file6} or a set [0-9] [a-zA-Z] or [p1K]
- `[!]` or `[^]` - Negation of group or set of characters; is used with square brackets, like [!1-5]

examples
```bash
rm file{1-6}

cp ~/.* /mnt/usb/

git add *.scm
```

Glob vs regex

Some symbols have the same meaning. These are symbols like curly brackets `{}` and square brackets `[]`.

`*` in glob means either zero or any number of characters
`*` in regex means zero or more of the previous character

`?` in glob means any one character
`?` In regex means zero or only one of the previous characters

`.` in regex means the same as what `?` means in globbing
`.*` in regex means the same as `*` in glob patterns

### pipe

| pipe - connect output first command to input next command

```bash
# copy public key to clipboard 
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

# find keyword in ls results
ls ~/.ssh | grep digital

# check last commands in history
history | tail -20

# grep all with "m"
echo -e "Hmm...\nBrr...\nMmm..." | grep "m"
```

### math

#### Arithmetic operators

| Op. | Function       | Description                                    | Example    | Result |
| --- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| +   | Addition       | Add two operands                               | $((10+3))  | 13     |
| -   | Subtraction    | Subtract two operands                          | $((10-3))  | 7      |

```bash
#!usr/bin/env/bash

#Executing simple arithmetic operations
echo $(( 10*5+15 ))
echo $(( 40/6 ))
```

#### Operations with a variable
| Operator | Function                   | Description                     | Example     | Result |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| +=       | Addition by constant       | Add two operands                | $((_x_+=3)) | 13     |

echo $val1

# Arithmetic operations using constants
# both `val=$(( 2 ))` and `$(( val = 2 ))` to assign values to vars
echo $(( val1 *= 3 ))
```


#### Relational and logical operations

`bc` utility provides us the ability to work with previously described operators as well as:
- Relational operators
- Logical or Boolean operators
- Math functions
- Conditional statements
- Iterative statements

| Op. | Example       | Evaluation logic                  | Result |
| --- | ------------- | --------------------------------- | ------ |
| &&  | bc <<< "5&&6" | 1; if all operands are non-zero   | 1      |
| \|  | bc <<< "5\|6" | 1; if any one operand is non-zero | 1      |
| !   | bc <<< "!5"   | 1; if the operand is 0            | 0      |

```bash
#!usr/bin/env/bash

# syntax command argument <<< "input"
# Less than operator
bc <<< "10 < 1"

# Is not equal to operator
bc <<< "10 != 11"
```

#### Math library

option `-l` enables the standard math library

| Math func. | Explanation                                                        | Example             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| sine       | Takes radian value as operand and gives its sine value             | bc -l <<< "s(30)"   |
| cosine     | Takes radian value as operand and gives its cosine value           | bc -l <<< "c(30)"   |
| tan-1      | Gives the inverse tangent in radians                               | bc -l <<< "a(1)"    |
| _ln_       | Gives the natural logarithm                                        | bc -l <<< "l(45)"   |
| _e_        | Raises _e_(euler's number i.e. 2.7182) to the power of the operand | bc -l <<< "e(1)"    |
| âˆš          | Returns square root value                                          | bc -l <<< "sqrt(9)" |

```bash
#!usr/bin/env/bash

#Arithmetic operation that returns a floating-point number
bc -l <<< "(1 + 2)/7 * 2 ** 2"

#Using sine and cosine functions
bc -l <<< "s(1) + c(1)"

#Using logarithmic and exponential functions
bc -l <<< "e(1) + l(5)"

#Finding the square root of a number
bc -l <<< "sqrt(27)"

#Converting binary 10 to octal
bc -l <<< "ibase=2; obase=8; 10"

#Converting decimal 5 to binary
bc -l <<< "obase=2; 5"

#Using scale to control length of floating-point numbers
bc -l <<< "scale=3; a(30)"
```

### File redirections

`>>` appends new content to the file without removing the old information.

```bash
# adding new information to a diary
echo "Also my favorite things are ..." >> diary.txt

# example with folder
pwd >> ~/todo.txt
echo "^delete if using in docker" >> ~/todo.txt
```

`>` overwrites the file, removing any old content.

```bash
# rewrite/create file content
echo "My new everlasting love is ..." > secret.txt
```

#### stdout, stderr redirections

```bash
# program.sh
echo "Just a normal message"
echo "it will goes to stdout"
# >&2 directs the "ERROR!" message to stderr, represented by descriptor 2
echo "ERROR!" >&2
echo "one more error" >&2
echo "it will goes to stdout too"
echo "one last error" >&2
```

```bash
# 1> redirects all stdout (non-error) output to file
# 2> redirects all stderr output to file
bash program.sh 1> log.txt 2> errors.txt
```

## File Permissions

`drwx------    38 my.username  staff   1.2K Mar  4 13:07 .zsh_sessions`

```bash
# check prmissions
ls -l echo.txt 
-rw-r--r--@ 1 my.user  staff  24 Jun 27 21:15 echo.txt

# change owner
chown superman:marvel ./save_the_world.txt
```

In addition to the user name and group, each file has associated access rights: r - read, w - write and x - execute. These permissions are set for three types of users: the Owner, users belonging to the same group (Group), and Other (those who are not included in the previous two groups).

## Multiple commands in one line

```bash
# No matter the first command run successfully or not, run the second command cmd2:
cd; ls

# Only when the first command cmd1 run successfully, run the second command cmd2
cd && ls

# Only when the first command cmd1 failed to run, run the second command cmd2
cd || ls
```

## Built-in commands

| -a                | Logical AND | `if [ EXPR1 -a EXPR2 ]` |
| -o                | Logical OR  | `if [ EXPR1 -o EXPR2 ]` |

### history

stores in `.zsh_history` / `.bash_history`

```bash
# show history
history

# clear history
history -c 
```

### wc

prints X newlines, X words, X bytes counts for file

```bash
wc echo.txtÂ 
# stdout >> 3 Â  Â  Â  5Â  Â  Â  24 echo.txt

echo "Hello world" | wc
```

If you do not specify any files and run `wc` - terminal will read standard data input. When you finish, go to a new line and press the `Ctrl + D` key combination.
### tr

can translate, squeeze, and delete characters from standard input, writing to standard output. The program processes the text character by character

`tr <options>... <set1> <set2>`

- `-d` delete
- `-s` remove duplicates

```bash
echo lalala | tr a o
# lololo

echo 'Linux Ubuntu' | tr -d 'u'
# Linx Ubnt

echo 'Repeated  spaces in  line' | tr -s [:space:]
# Repeated spaces in line

```

### chown

`chown user <option> /path/to/file`

### chmod

`chmod permissions filename`

```bash
chmod 751 modify_it_now.exe

# modifying user permissions
chmod u=rwx modify_it_now.exe

# modifying group permissions
chmod g=r+x modify_it_now.exe

# modifying other permissions
chmod o=r+w modify_it_now.exe
```

### which

```

### less

Open a file for interactive reading, allowing scrolling and search

```bash
set | less

ps aux | lessn

# shortcuts - Forward search for a string (press `n`/`N` to go tonext/previous match):
	# /something
# Backward search for a string (press `n`/`N` to go to next/previous match): 
	# ?something

## Shell Scripts

### Therms

`#!` - "shebang"
Directive for the Linux program loader that specifies a program that will run the script

`#!/usr/bin/env python3` - python example

### Run a script

* open the corresponding directory with file and type `bash hello_world.sh`
* make the file executable by typing `chmod +x hello_world.sh`
  Then can run it `./hello_world.sh`

### Positional parameters

null parameter `$0` is always the name of the script, and then follows user parameters passed to a script

Syntax

`$#` total number of the parameters
`$* , $@` - all parameters

Example
`personal_data.sh`

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "You provided $# facts about yourself!"
echo "Your name is $1"
echo "Your age is $2"
echo "All parameters in one var: $*"
echo "$@" # All arguments passed to the script
```

run

```bash
$ bash personal_data.sh Pepe 13

stdout:
You provided 2 facts about yourself!
Your name is Pepe
Your age is 33
All parameters in line: Pepe 33
All parameters by words: Pepe 33
```

### Functions

syntax

`function function_name {}`
or
`function_name() {}`

example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

personal_data() {
    echo "You provided $# facts about yourself!"
    echo "Your name is $1"
    echo "Your age is $2"
}

personal_data "Elden Lord" 200026
```

### Case statement

case statement is easy to read when there are multiple conditional statements

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

case "${1}" in

    "")       # condition 
        echo "No option was selected." 
        ;; # end of the command
    1)     
        echo "You selected '1'." 
        ;;
    2)     
        echo "You selected '2'." 
        ;;
    3)     
        echo "You selected '3'." 
        ;;
    *)     # default case == else
        echo "Unknown number '${1}'." 
        ;;

esac

# syntax example
case $variable in
    condition-1 )
        commands;;
    condition-2 )
        commands;;
    condition-3 )
        commands;;
    condition-N )
        commands;;
    * )
        commands;;
esac

```


### Shift statement

`shift` - command that helps to iterate within list of arguments in function. like `i++` statement

example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

answers=("a" "d" "c" "a" "a")
total_score=0

for (( i = 0; i < 5; i++));
do
    case "${1}" in

        ${answers[i]})
            ((total_score++))
            ;;
        "-"|"--") # `|` bitwise operator 'OR'
            ;;
        *)
            ((total_score--))
            ;;

    esac
    shift 1 ## equal i + 1
done

echo "Total score is: $total_score"
```

### if-statement

```bash
# syntax
if [conditions]; then
   commands
fi

###
# elif
if test-commands; then
    consequent-commands
elif more-test-commands; then
    more-consequents
else
    some-more-consequents
fi
```

```bash
# Checking the password entered by user

echo "Enter password: "
read input
if [ $input = "Pass!@#" ]; then
    echo "Correct password entered"
fi

###
# add else block
if [ $input = "Pass!@#" ]; then
    echo "Correct password entered"
else
    echo "Incorrect password entered"
fi

###
# elif
num1=20;
num2=10;

if [ "$num1" -eq "$num2" ]; then
    echo "Numbers are equal"
elif [ "$num1" -gt "$num2" ]; then
    echo "First number is greater"
else
    echo "Second number is greater"
fi
```

### for

```bash
# syntax
for variable in set_of_values
do
    command
done

###
# example
$ for i in 1 2 3 4 5 do 
    echo $i 
  done

###
# example 2
for i in John Jack Mary do 
    echo "Here is $i" 
done

###
# using seq (seq [start] [incr] [stop])
for i in $(seq 1 2 5); do 
    echo "Number: $i"
  done
```

### while

```bash
# syntax
while control-command
do
    command
done

###
# example
i=1
while [ $i -le 3 ] do 
	echo "I is $i" 
    i=$(($i+1))
done

```

### Error handling

default, bash does not halt the execution of the script. 
if any command in the pipeline fails (returns a non-zero exit status), the entire pipeline is considered to have failed, even if some commands in the pipeline were successful

`set -euo pipefail` # shell options
	-exit on error
	-undefined vars caused exit
	-output will show last successful command

### Read User Input

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo Write Mario

read mario

# OR with one line
# read -p "Write Mario: " mario

echo "It's me, $mario"
```

### Read file

read lines from file

```bash
#!/bin/bash

filename='example.txt'
while read line; do
    echo "Your line:  $line"
done < "$filename"
```

get lines from file and save to another file

```bash
filename='example.txt'
output='junior.txt'

while read line; do
    echo "Your line:  $line" >> junior.txt
done < "$filename"
```

## Shell config

![](../../aaa-assets/cli-1.png)

### PATH

`$PATH` environment variable. It contains the directories that the shell searches for executable files
It's a list of directory paths, separated by colons (`:`)

`/bin` - default system executable files

`/usr/bin`  - default user executable files

`/usr/local/bin` - bins for manually installed user-apps (docker, WARP, etc)

`/opt/homebrew/bin` - created and maintained by Brew

`/etc/paths` - system path

```bash
# a default $PATH looks like
# search order from left /usr/local/bin to right /sbin
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin

# update PATCH data for current shell session
PATH=$PATH:/path-to-your-directory
export PATH

# pretty print
printenv PATH | tr ':' '\n'
```

### alias - Aliases

```bash
# to save it in shell zsh - ~/.zshrc
nano ~/.bashrc

# add alias, add ssh key, save file
alias key='ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/id_rsa'
alias any-key='any-thing'

# reset shell environment
source ~/.bashrc

# check current list of aliases
alias

# to remove (for aliases added by command, not file)
unalias key
```

## OS programs

### Processes

Signals

|              |                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SIGTERM (15) | Terminate signal. The default signal sent by the kernel to a process requesting it to terminate. It is a safe method of terminating processes since it allows the process to clean up. |
| SIGINT (2)   | Interrupt signal. This signal performs the same function as pressing Ctrl+C on a terminal. It usually terminates the program.                                                          |
| SIGKILL (9)  | Kill signal. Signal is not sent to the target process, the kernel directly terminates the process and so this signal cannot be ignored by the process.                                 |
| SIGSTOP (19) | Stop signal. It causes a process to pause without terminating it. Similar to SIGKILL, this signal isn't directly sent to the target process and hence cannot be ignored.               |
| SIGHUP (1)   | Hang up signal. It's used to reload a process.                                                                                                                                         |

```bash
# report a snapshot of the current processes
ps

# get list of signals
kill -l

# turn off proccess
kill 5642 5789 6754

# Using the full name of the signal
kill -SIGINT 5642

# Using the short name of the signal
kill -INT 5642

# Using the signal number
kill -2 5642

# Sends SIGTERM signal to all the Firefox processes

## exit codes

|Exit code|Description|
|---|---|
|Exit code 0|Indicates the successful termination of a command or program without any errors.|
|Exit code 1|Usually represents a generic "catch-all" error code. It is often used to indicate that a command or program encountered an unspecified error condition.|
|Exit code 2|Typically indicates incorrect usage or invalid arguments passed to a command or script.|
|Exit code 126|Suggests that the execution of invoked command or script was unsuccessful, usually due to insufficient permissions.|
|Exit code 127|Signifies that the command or script could not be found or executed.|
|Exit code 130|Commonly used to indicate the termination of a program by the user, typically by pressing _Ctrl+C_ to send a SIGINT signal.|
