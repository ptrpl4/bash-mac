# üçû README

### Greetings!

Hi, this is my personal Tech Wiki.

New materials will be in English, old materials may contain notes in Russian, but translation is already underway.

Main themes - programming languages - python, go, js, also testing frameworks and patterns, hardware devices like flipper zero, developer utilities and other fascinating tech stuff!

Most of this content is written as a way to memorize and may contain errors and reductions.
